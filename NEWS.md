# gsDesign 3.3.0 (May, 2022)

- Addition of vignettes
  - Demonstrate cure model and calendar-based analysis timing for time-to-event endpoint design
  - Vaccine efficacy design using spending bounds and exact binomial boundary crossing probabilities
- Minor fix to labeling in print.gsProbability
- Fixed error in sfStep
- Updates to reduce R CMD check and other minor issues 

# gsDesign 3.2.2 (January, 2022)

- Use `inherits()` instead of `is()` to determine if an object is an instance of a class, when appropriate
- Correctly close graphics device in unit tests to avoid plot output file not found issues
- Minor fixes to hGraph() for multiplicity graphs
- Minor fix to nBinomial() when odds-ratio scale specified to resolve user issue
- Minor changes to vignettes

# gsDesign 3.2.1 (July, 2021)

- Changed gt package usage in a vignette due to deprecated gt function
- Replied to minor comments from CRAN reviewer (no functionality impact)
- Minor update to DESCRIPTION citing Jennison and Turnbull reference

# gsDesign 3.2.0 (January, 2021)

- Substantially updated unit testing to increase code coverage above 80%
- Updated error checking messages to print function where check fails
- Removed dependencies on plyr packages
- Updated github actions 
 
# gsDesign 3.1.1 (May, 2020)

- Vignettes updated
- Added `hGraph()` to support ggplot2 versions of multiplicity graphs
- Eliminated unnecessary check from `sequentialPValue`
- Targeted release to CRAN
- Removed dependencies on reshape2, plyr
- Updated continuous integration
- Updated license

# gsDesign 3.1.0 (April, 2019)

- Addition of pkgdown web site
- Updated unit testing to from RUnit to testthat
- Converted to roxygen2 generation of help files
- Converted vignettes to R Markdown
- Added Travis-CI and Appveyor support
- Added `sequentialPValue` function
- Backwards compatible addition of spending time capabilities to `gsDesign` and `gsSurv`

# gsDesign 3.0-5 (January, 2018)

- Registered C routines
- Fixed "gsbound"
- Replaced "array" by "rep" calls to avoid `R CMD check` warnings

# gsDesign 3.0-4 (September, 2017)

- First Github-based release
- Cleaned up documentation for `nBinomial1Sample()`
- Updated documentation and code (including one default value for an argument) for `nBinomial1Sample()` to improve error handling and clarity 
- Updated `sfLDOF()` to generalize with rho parameter; still backwards compatible for Lan-DeMets O'Brien-Fleming

# gsDesign 3.0-3

- Introduced spending time as a separate concept from information time to enable concepts such as calendar-based spending functions. The only user function changed is the `gsDesign()` function and the change is the addition of the parameters `usTime` and `lsTime`; default behavior is backwards compatible.

# gsDesign 3.0-2 (February, 2016)

- Simplified conditional power section of gsDesignManual.pdf in doc directory
- Corrected basic calculation in `gsCP()`
- Eliminated deprecated ggplot2 function `opts()`

# gsDesign 3.0-1 (January, 2016)

- More changes to comply with R standards (in NAMESPACE - `importFrom` statements - and DESCRIPTION - adding plyr to imports) ensuring appropriate references.
- Deleted link in documentation that no longer exists (gsBinomialExact.Rd).
- Last planned RForge-based release; moving to Github.

# gsDesign 3.0-0 (December, 2015)

- Updated xtable extension to meet R standards for extensions. 
- Fixed `xtable.gsSurv` and `print.gsSurv` to work with 1-sided designs
- Update to calls to ggplot to replace show_guide (deprecated) with `show.legend` arguments where used in `ggplot2::geom_text` calls; no user impact
- Minor typo fixed in `sfLogistic` help file
- Cleaned up "imports" and "depends" in an effort to be an R "good citizen"
- Registered S3 methods in NAMESPACE

# gsDesign 2.9-4

- Minor edit to package description to comply with R standards

# gsDesign 2.9-3 (November, 2014)

- Added `sfTrimmed` as likely preferred spending function approach to skipping early or all interim efficacy analyses; this also can adjust bound when final analysis is performed with less than maximum planned information. Updated `help(sfTrimmed)` to demonstrate these capabilities.
- Added `sfGapped`, which is primarily intended to eliminate futility analyses later in a study; see `help(sfGapped)` for an example
- Added `summary.spendfn()` to provide textual summary of spending functions; this simplified the print function for gsDesign objects
- Added `sfStep()` which can be used to set an interim spend when the exact amount of information is unknown; an example of how this can be misused is provided in the help file
- Fixed rounding so that `gsBoundSummary`, `xtable.gsSurv` and `summary.gsDesign` are consistent for `gsSurv` objects
