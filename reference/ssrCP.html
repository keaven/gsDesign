<meta property="og:title" content="Sample size re-estimation based on conditional power — condPower" />
<meta property="og:description" content="ssrCP() adapts 2-stage group sequential designs to 2-stage sample
size re-estimation designs based on interim analysis conditional power. This
is a simple case of designs developed by Lehmacher and Wassmer, Biometrics
(1999). The conditional power designs of Bauer and Kohne (1994), 
Proschan and Hunsberger (1995), Cui, Hung and Wang (1999) and Liu and Chi (2001), 
Gao, Ware and Mehta (2008), and Mehta and Pocock (2011). Either the estimated
treatment effect at the interim analysis or any chosen effect size can be
used for sample size re-estimation. If not done carefully, these designs can
be very inefficient. It is probably a good idea to compare any design to a
simpler group sequential design; see, for example, Jennison and Turnbull
(2003). The a assumes a small Type I error is included with the interim
analysis and that the design is an adaptation from a 2-stage group
sequential design Related functions include 3 pre-defined combination test
functions (z2NC, z2Z, z2Fisher) that represent the
inverse normal combination test (Lehmacher and Wassmer, 1999), the
sufficient statistic for the complete data, and Fisher's combination test.
Power.ssrCP computes unconditional power for a conditional power
design derived by ssrCP.
condPower is a supportive routine that also is interesting in its own
right; it computes conditional power of a combination test given an interim
test statistic, stage 2 sample size and combindation test statistic. While
the returned data frame should make general plotting easy, the function
plot.ssrCP() prints a plot of study sample size by stage 1 outcome
with multiple x-axis labels for stage 1 z-value, conditional power, and
stage 1 effect size relative to the effect size for which the underlying
group sequential design was powered.
Sample size re-estimation using conditional power and an interim estimate of
treatment effect was proposed by several authors in the 1990's (see
references below). Statistical testing for these original methods was based
on combination tests since Type I error could be inflated by using a
sufficient statistic for testing at the end of the trial. Since 2000, more
efficient variations of these conditional power designs have been developed.
Fully optimized designs have also been derived (Posch et all, 2003,
Lokhnygina and Tsiatis, 2008). Some of the later conditional power methods
allow use of sufficient statistics for testing (Chen, DeMets and Lan, 2004,
Gao, Ware and Mehta, 2008, and Mehta and Pocock, 2011).
The methods considered here are extensions of 2-stage group sequential
designs that include both an efficacy and a futility bound at the planned
interim analysis. A maximum fold-increase in sample size (maxinc)from
the supplied group sequential design (x) is specified by the user, as
well as a range of conditional power (cpadj) where sample size should
be re-estimated at the interim analysis, 1-the targeted conditional power to
be used for sample size re-estimation (beta) and a combination test
statistic (z2) to be used for testing at the end of the trial. The
input value overrun represents incremental enrollment not included in
the interim analysis that is not included in the analysis; this is used for
calculating the required number of patients enrolled to complete the trial.
Whereas most of the methods proposed have been based on using the interim
estimated treatment effect size (default for ssrCP), the variable
theta allows the user to specify an alternative; Liu and Chi (2001)
suggest that using the parameter value for which the trial was originally
powered is a good choice." />
