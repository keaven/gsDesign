intervals and simulation for fixed sample size trials (that is, not group
sequential or adaptive) with two arms and binary outcomes.  Both superiority
and non-inferiority trials are considered. While all routines default to
comparisons of risk-difference, options to base computations on risk-ratio
and odds-ratio are also included.
nBinomial() computes sample size or power using the method of
Farrington and Manning (1990) for a trial to test the difference between two
binomial event rates.  The routine can be used for a test of superiority or
non-inferiority. For a design that tests for superiority nBinomial()
is consistent with the method of Fleiss, Tytun, and Ury (but without the
continuity correction) to test for differences between event rates. This
routine is consistent with the Hmisc package routines bsamsize and
bpower for superiority designs. Vector arguments allow computing
sample sizes for multiple scenarios for comparative purposes.
testBinomial() computes a Z- or Chi-square-statistic that compares
two binomial event rates using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen (1980).
This can be used for superiority or non-inferiority testing. Vector
arguments allow easy incorporation into simulation routines for fixed, group
sequential and adaptive designs.
ciBinomial() computes confidence intervals for 1) the difference
between two rates, 2) the risk-ratio for two rates or 3) the odds-ratio for
two rates. This procedure provides inference that is consistent with
testBinomial() in that the confidence intervals are produced by
inverting the testing procedures in testBinomial(). The Type I error
alpha input to ciBinomial is always interpreted as 2-sided.
simBinomial() performs simulations to estimate the power for a
Miettinen and Nurminen (1985) test comparing two binomial rates for
superiority or non-inferiority.  As noted in documentation for
bpower.sim() in the HMisc package, by using testBinomial() you
can see that the formulas without any continuity correction are quite
accurate.  In fact, Type I error for a continuity-corrected test is
significantly lower (Gordon and Watson, 1996) than the nominal rate.  Thus,
as a default no continuity corrections are performed.
varBinomial computes blinded estimates of the variance of the
estimate of 1) event rate differences, 2) logarithm of the risk ratio, or 3)
logarithm of the odds ratio. This is intended for blinded sample size
re-estimation for comparative trials with a binary outcome.
Testing is 2-sided when a Chi-square statistic is used and 1-sided when a
Z-statistic is used. Thus, these 2 options will produce substantially
different results, in general. For non-inferiority, 1-sided testing is
appropriate.
You may wish to round sample sizes up using ceiling().
Farrington and Manning (1990) begin with event rates p1 and p2
under the alternative hypothesis and a difference between these rates under
the null hypothesis, delta0. From these values, actual rates under
the null hypothesis are computed, which are labeled p10 and
p20 when outtype=3. The rates p1 and p2 are used
to compute a variance for a Z-test comparing rates under the alternative
hypothesis, while p10 and p20 are used under the null
hypothesis. This computational method is also used to estimate variances in
varBinomial() based on the overall event rate observed and the input
treatment difference specified in delta0.
Sample size with scale="Difference" produces an error if
p1-p2=delta0.  Normally, the alternative hypothesis under
consideration would be p1-p2-delta0$&amp;gt;0$. However, the alternative can
have p1-p2-delta0$&amp;lt;0$.'><meta property="og:description" content='Support is provided for sample size estimation, power, testing, confidence
