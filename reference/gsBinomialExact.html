<meta property="og:description" content="gsBinomialExact computes power/Type I error and expected sample size

This can also be used to compare event rates in two-arm studies. The print

based on predictive probability.
nBinomial1Sample uses exact binomial calculations to compute power
and sample size for single arm binomial experiments.
gsBinomialExact is based on the book &quot;Group Sequential Methods with
Applications to Clinical Trials,&quot; Christopher Jennison and Bruce W.
Turnbull, Chapter 12, Section 12.1.2 Exact Calculations for Binary Data.
This computation is often used as an approximation for the distribution of
the number of events in one treatment group out of all events when the
probability of an event is small and sample size is large.
An object of class gsBinomialExact is returned. On output, the values
of theta input to gsBinomialExact will be the parameter values
for which the boundary crossing probabilities and expected sample sizes are
computed.
Note that a[1] equal to -1 lower bound at n.I[1] means 0 successes continues
at interim 1; a[2]==0 at interim 2 means 0 successes stops trial for
futility at 2nd analysis.  For final analysis, set a[k] equal to b[k]-1 to
incorporate all possibilities into non-positive trial; see example.
The sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) is a sequential testing scheme
allowing testing after each observation. This likelihood ratio is used to
determine upper and lower cutoffs which are linear and parallel in the
number of responses as a function of sample size.  binomialSPRT
produces a variation the the SPRT that tests only within a range of sample
sizes. While the linear SPRT bounds are continuous, actual bounds are the
integer number of response at or beyond each linear bound for each sample
size where testing is performed. Because of the truncation and
discretization of the bounds, power and Type I error achieve will be lower
than the nominal levels specified by alpha and beta which can
be altered to produce desired values that are achieved by the planned sample
size. See also example that shows computation of Type I error when futility
bound is considered non-binding.
Note that if the objective of a design is to demonstrate that a rate (e.g.,
failure rate) is lower than a certain level, two approaches can be taken.
First, 1 minus the failure rate is the success rate and this can be used for
planning. Second, the role of beta becomes to express Type I error
and alpha is used to express Type II error.
Plots produced include boundary plots, expected sample size, response rate
at the boundary and power.
gsBinomial1Sample uses exact binomial computations based on the base
R functions qbinom() and pbinom(). The tabular output may be
convenient for plotting. Note that input variables are largely not checked,
so the user is largely responsible for results; it is a good idea to do a
run with outtype=3 to check that you have done things appropriately.
If n is not ordered (a bad idea) or not sequential (maybe OK), be
aware of possible consequences.
nBinomial1Sample is based on code from Marc Schwartz marc_schwartz@me.com. 
The possible sample size vector n needs to be selected in such a fashion
that it covers the possible range of values that include the true minima. 
NOTE: the one-sided evaluation of significance is more conservative than using the 2-sided exact test in binom.test." />
