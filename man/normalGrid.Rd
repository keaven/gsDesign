\usage{
normalGrid(r = 18, bounds = c(0, 0), mu = 0, sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Control for grid points as in Jennison and Turnbull (2000), Chapter
19; default is 18. Range: 1 to 80.  This might be changed by the user (e.g.,
\code{r=6} which produces 65 gridpoints compare to 185 points when
\code{r=18}) when speed is more important than precision.}

\item{bounds}{Range of integration. Real-valued vector of length 2. Default
value of 0, 0 produces a range of + or - 6 standard deviations (6*sigma)
from the mean (=mu).}

\item{mu}{Mean of the desired normal distribution.}

\item{sigma}{Standard deviation of the desired normal distribution.}
}
\value{
\item{z}{Grid points for numerical integration.} \item{density}{The
standard normal density function evaluated at the values in \code{z}; see
examples.} \item{gridwgts}{Simpson's rule weights for numerical integration
on the grid in \code{z}; see examples.} \item{wgts}{Weights to be used with
the grid in \code{z} for integrating the normal density function; see
examples. This is equal to \code{density * gridwgts}.}
}
\description{
normalGrid() is intended to be used for computation of the expected value of
a function of a normal random variable.  The function produces grid points
and weights to be used for numerical integration.

This is a utility function to provide a normal density function and a grid
to integrate over as described by Jennison and Turnbull (2000), Chapter 19.
While integration can be performed over the real line or over any portion of
it, the numerical integration does not extend beyond 6 standard deviations
from the mean. The grid used for integration uses equally spaced points over
the middle of the distribution function, and spreads points further apart in
the tails. The values returned in \code{gridwgts} may be used to integrate
any function over the given grid, although the user should take care that
the function integrated is not large in the tails of the grid where points
are spread further apart.

\examples{
library(ggplot2)
#  standard normal distribution
x <- normalGrid(r = 3)
plot(x$z, x$wgts)

#  verify that numerical integration replicates sigma
#  get grid points and weights
x <- normalGrid(mu = 2, sigma = 3)

# compute squared deviation from mean for grid points
dev <- (x$z - 2)^2

# multiply squared deviations by integration weights and sum
sigma2 <- sum(dev * x$wgts)

# square root of sigma2 should be sigma (3)
sqrt(sigma2)

# do it again with larger r to increase accuracy
x <- normalGrid(r = 22, mu = 2, sigma = 3)
sqrt(sum((x$z - 2)^2 * x$wgts))

# this can also be done by combining gridwgts and density
sqrt(sum((x$z - 2)^2 * x$gridwgts * x$density))

# integrate normal density and compare to built-in function
# to compute probability of being within 1 standard deviation
# of the mean
pnorm(1) - pnorm(-1)
x <- normalGrid(bounds = c(-1, 1))
sum(x$wgts)
sum(x$gridwgts * x$density)
