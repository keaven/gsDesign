\arguments{
\item{test.type}{Test type. See \code{\link{gsSurv}}.}

\item{alpha}{Type I error rate. Default is 0.025 since 1-sided
testing is default.}

\item{sided}{\code{1} for 1-sided testing, \code{2} for 2-sided testing.}

\item{beta}{Type II error rate. Default is 0.10
(90\% power); \code{NULL} if power is to be computed based on
other input values.}

\item{astar}{Normally not specified. If \code{test.type = 5}
or \code{6}, \code{astar} specifies the total probability
of crossing a lower bound at all analyses combined. This
will be changed to \code{1 - alpha} when default value of
\code{0} is used. Since this is the expected usage,
normally \code{astar} is not specified by the user.}

\item{sfu}{A spending function or a character string
indicating a boundary type (that is, \code{"WT"} for
Wang-Tsiatis bounds, \code{"OF"} for O'Brien-Fleming bounds and
\code{"Pocock"} for Pocock bounds). For one-sided and symmetric
two-sided testing is used to completely specify spending
(\code{test.type = 1}, \code{2}), \code{sfu}. The default value is
\code{sfHSD} which is a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function.}

\item{sfupar}{Real value, default is \code{-4} which is an
O'Brien-Fleming-like conservative bound when used with the
default Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function. This is a
real-vector for many spending functions. The parameter
\code{sfupar} specifies any parameters needed for the spending
function specified by \code{sfu}; this will be ignored for
spending functions (\code{sfLDOF}, \code{sfLDPocock})
or bound types (\code{"OF"}, \code{"Pocock"})
that do not require parameters.}

\item{sfl}{Specifies the spending function for lower
boundary crossing probabilities when asymmetric,
two-sided testing is performed
(\code{test.type = 3}, \code{4}, \code{5}, or \code{6}).
Unlike the upper bound,
only spending functions are used to specify the lower bound.
The default value is \code{sfHSD} which is a
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function. The parameter
\code{sfl} is ignored for one-sided testing
(\code{test.type = 1}) or symmetric 2-sided testing
(\code{test.type = 2}).}

\item{sflpar}{Real value, default is \code{-2}, which, with the
default Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function, specifies a
less conservative spending rate than the default for the
upper bound.}

\item{calendarTime}{Vector of increasing positive numbers
with calendar times of analyses. Time 0 is start of
randomization.}

\item{spending}{Select between calendar-based spending and
information-based spending.}

\item{lambdaC}{Scalar, vector or matrix of event hazard
rates for the control group; rows represent time periods while
columns represent strata; a vector implies a single stratum.}

\item{hr}{Hazard ratio (experimental/control) under the
alternate hypothesis (scalar).}

\item{hr0}{Hazard ratio (experimental/control) under the null
hypothesis (scalar).}

\item{eta}{Scalar, vector or matrix of dropout hazard rates
for the control group; rows represent time periods while
columns represent strata; if entered as a scalar, rate is
constant across strata and time periods; if entered as a
vector, rates are constant across strata.}

\item{etaE}{Matrix dropout hazard rates for the experimental
group specified in like form as \code{eta}; if \code{NULL},
this is set equal to \code{eta}.}

\item{gamma}{A scalar, vector or matrix of rates of entry by
time period (rows) and strata (columns); if entered as a
scalar, rate is constant across strata and time periods;
if entered as a vector, rates are constant across strata.}

\item{R}{A scalar or vector of durations of time periods for
recruitment rates specified in rows of \code{gamma}. Length is the
same as number of rows in \code{gamma}. Note that when variable
enrollment duration is specified (input \code{T = NULL}), the final
enrollment period is extended as long as needed.}

\item{S}{A scalar or vector of durations of piecewise constant
event rates specified in rows of \code{lambda}, \code{eta} and \code{etaE};
this is \code{NULL} if there is a single event rate per stratum
(exponential failure) or length of the number of rows in \code{lambda}
minus 1, otherwise.}

\item{minfup}{A non-negative scalar less than the maximum value
in \code{calendarTime}. Enrollment will be cut off at the
difference between the maximum value in \code{calendarTime}
and \code{minfup}.}

\item{ratio}{Randomization ratio of experimental treatment
divided by control; normally a scalar, but may be a vector with
length equal to number of strata.}

\item{r}{Integer value (>= 1 and <= 80) controlling the number of numerical
integration grid points. Default is 18, as recommended by Jennison and
Turnbull (2000). Grid points are spread out in the tails for accurate
probability calculations. Larger values provide more grid points and greater
accuracy but slow down computation. Jennison and Turnbull (p. 350) note an
accuracy of \eqn{10^{-6}} with \code{r = 16}. This parameter is normally
not changed by users.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for error passed to the \code{\link{gsDesign}} function.}

\examples{
# First example: while timing is calendar-based, spending is event-based
x <- gsSurvCalendar() |> toInteger()
gsBoundSummary(x)

# Second example: both timing and spending are calendar-based
# This results in less spending at interims and leaves more for final analysis
y <- gsSurvCalendar(spending = "calendar") |> toInteger()
gsBoundSummary(y)

# Note that calendar timing for spending relates to planned timing for y
# rather than timing in y after toInteger() conversion

# Values plugged into spending function for calendar time
y$usTime
# Actual calendar fraction from design after toInteger() conversion
y$T / max(y$T)
