\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{nSurv} or \code{gsSurv}.
\code{print.nSurv()} is used for an object of class \code{nSurv} which will
generally be output from \code{nSurv()}. For \code{print.gsSurv()} is used
for an object of class \code{gsSurv} which will generally be output from
\code{gsSurv()}. \code{nEventsIA} and \code{tEventsIA} operate on both the
\code{nSurv} and \code{gsSurv} class.}

\item{digits}{Number of digits past the decimal place to print
(\code{print.gsSurv.}); also a pass through to generic \code{xtable()} from
\code{xtable.gsSurv()}.}

\item{...}{other arguments that may be passed to generic functions
underlying the methods here.}

\item{lambdaC}{scalar, vector or matrix of event hazard rates for the
control group; rows represent time periods while columns represent strata; a
vector implies a single stratum.}

\item{hr}{hazard ratio (experimental/control) under the alternate hypothesis
(scalar).}

\item{hr0}{hazard ratio (experimental/control) under the null hypothesis
(scalar).}

\item{eta}{scalar, vector or matrix of dropout hazard rates for the control
group; rows represent time periods while columns represent strata; if
entered as a scalar, rate is constant across strata and time periods; if
entered as a vector, rates are constant across strata.}

\item{etaE}{matrix dropout hazard rates for the experimental group specified
in like form as \code{eta}; if NULL, this is set equal to \code{eta}.}

\item{gamma}{a scalar, vector or matrix of rates of entry by time period
(rows) and strata (columns); if entered as a scalar, rate is constant
across strata and time periods; if entered as a vector, rates are constant
across strata.}

\item{R}{a scalar or vector of durations of time periods for recruitment
rates specified in rows of \code{gamma}. Length is the same as number of
rows in \code{gamma}. Note that when variable enrollment duration is
specified (input \code{T=NULL}), the final enrollment period is extended as
long as needed.}

\item{S}{a scalar or vector of durations of piecewise constant event rates
specified in rows of \code{lambda}, \code{eta} and \code{etaE}; this is NULL
if there is a single event rate per stratum (exponential failure) or length
of the number of rows in \code{lambda} minus 1, otherwise.}

\item{T}{study duration; if \code{T} is input as \code{NULL}, this will be
computed on output; see details.}

\item{minfup}{follow-up of last patient enrolled; if \code{minfup} is input
as \code{NULL}, this will be computed on output; see details.}

\item{ratio}{randomization ratio of experimental treatment divided by
control; normally a scalar, but may be a vector with length equal to number
of strata.}

\item{alpha}{type I error rate. Default is 0.025 since 1-sided testing is
default.}

\item{beta}{type II error rate. Default is 0.10 (90\% power); NULL if power
is to be computed based on other input values.}

\item{sided}{1 for 1-sided testing, 2 for 2-sided testing.}

\item{tol}{for cases when \code{T} or \code{minfup} values are derived
through root finding (\code{T} or \code{minfup} input as \code{NULL}),
\code{tol} provides the level of error input to the \code{uniroot()}
root-finding function. The default is the same as for \code{\link{uniroot}}.}

\item{timing}{Sets relative timing of interim analyses in \code{gsSurv}.
Default of 1 produces equally spaced analyses.  Otherwise, this is a vector
of length \code{k} or \code{k-1}.  The values should satisfy \code{0 <
timing[1] < timing[2] < ... < timing[k-1] < timing[k]=1}. For
\code{tEventsIA}, this is a scalar strictly between 0 and 1 that indicates
the targeted proportion of final planned events available at an interim
analysis.}

\item{tIA}{Timing of an interim analysis; should be between 0 and
\code{y$T}.}

\item{target}{The targeted proportion of events at an interim analysis. This
is used for root-finding will be 0 for normal use.}

\item{simple}{See output specification for \code{nEventsIA()}.}

\item{k}{Number of analyses planned, including interim and final.}

\item{test.type}{\code{1=}one-sided \cr \code{2=}two-sided symmetric \cr
\code{3=}two-sided, asymmetric, beta-spending with binding lower bound \cr
\code{4=}two-sided, asymmetric, beta-spending with non-binding lower bound
\cr \code{5=}two-sided, asymmetric, lower bound spending under the null
hypothesis with binding lower bound \cr \code{6=}two-sided, asymmetric,
lower bound spending under the null hypothesis with non-binding lower bound.
\cr See details, examples and manual.}

\item{astar}{Normally not specified. If \code{test.type=5} or \code{6},
\code{astar} specifies the total probability of crossing a lower bound at
all analyses combined.  This will be changed to \eqn{1 - }\code{alpha} when
default value of 0 is used.  Since this is the expected usage, normally
\code{astar} is not specified by the user.}

\item{sfu}{A spending function or a character string indicating a boundary
type (that is, \dQuote{WT} for Wang-Tsiatis bounds, \dQuote{OF} for
O'Brien-Fleming bounds and \dQuote{Pocock} for Pocock bounds).  For
one-sided and symmetric two-sided testing is used to completely specify
spending (\code{test.type=1, 2}), \code{sfu}.  The default value is
\code{sfHSD} which is a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function.  See details,
\code{vignette("SpendingFunctionOverview")}, manual and examples.}

\item{sfupar}{Real value, default is \eqn{-4} which is an
O'Brien-Fleming-like conservative bound when used with the default
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function. This is a real-vector for many spending
functions.  The parameter \code{sfupar} specifies any parameters needed for
the spending function specified by \code{sfu}; this will be ignored for
spending functions (\code{sfLDOF}, \code{sfLDPocock}) or bound types
(\dQuote{OF}, \dQuote{Pocock}) that do not require parameters.
Note that \code{sfupar} can be specified as a positive scalar for
\code{sfLDOF} for a generalized O'Brien-Fleming spending function.}

\item{sfl}{Specifies the spending function for lower boundary crossing
probabilities when asymmetric, two-sided testing is performed
(\code{test.type = 3}, \code{4}, \code{5}, or \code{6}).  Unlike the upper
bound, only spending functions are used to specify the lower bound.  The
default value is \code{sfHSD} which is a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending
function.  The parameter \code{sfl} is ignored for one-sided testing
(\code{test.type=1}) or symmetric 2-sided testing (\code{test.type=2}).  See
details, spending functions, manual and examples.}

\item{sflpar}{Real value, default is \eqn{-2}, which, with the default
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function, specifies a less conservative spending
rate than the default for the upper bound.}

\item{r}{Integer value (>= 1 and <= 80) controlling the number of numerical
integration grid points. Default is 18, as recommended by Jennison and
Turnbull (2000). Grid points are spread out in the tails for accurate
probability calculations. Larger values provide more grid points and greater
accuracy but slow down computation. Jennison and Turnbull (p. 350) note an
accuracy of \eqn{10^{-6}} with \code{r = 16}. This parameter is normally
not changed by users.}

\item{usTime}{Default is NULL in which case upper bound spending time is
determined by \code{timing}. Otherwise, this should be a vector of length
\code{k} with the spending time at each analysis (see Details in help for \code{gsDesign}).}

\item{lsTime}{Default is NULL in which case lower bound spending time is
determined by \code{timing}. Otherwise, this should be a vector of length
\code{k} with the spending time at each analysis (see Details in help for \code{gsDesign}).}

\description{
\code{nSurv()} is used to calculate the sample size for a clinical trial
with a time-to-event endpoint and an assumption of proportional hazards.
This set of routines is new with version 2.7 and will continue to be
modified and refined to improve input error checking and output format with
subsequent versions. It allows both the Lachin and Foulkes (1986) method
(fixed trial duration) as well as the Kim and Tsiatis(1990) method (fixed
enrollment rates and either fixed enrollment duration or fixed minimum
follow-up). Piecewise exponential survival is supported as well as piecewise
constant enrollment and dropout rates. The methods are for a 2-arm trial
with treatment groups referred to as experimental and control. A stratified
population is allowed as in Lachin and Foulkes (1986); this method has been
extended to derive non-inferiority as well as superiority trials.
Stratification also allows power calculation for meta-analyses.
\code{gsSurv()} combines \code{nSurv()} with \code{gsDesign()} to derive a
group sequential design for a study with a time-to-event endpoint.
}
\details{
\code{print()}, \code{xtable()} and \code{summary()} methods are provided to
operate on the returned value from \code{gsSurv()}, an object of class
\code{gsSurv}. \code{print()} is also extended to \code{nSurv} objects. The
functions \code{\link{gsBoundSummary}} (data frame for tabular output),
\code{\link{xprint}} (application of \code{xtable} for tabular output) and
\code{summary.gsSurv} (textual summary of \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsSurv}
object) may be preferred summary functions; see example in vignettes. See
also \link{gsBoundSummary} for output
of tabular summaries of bounds for designs produced by \code{gsSurv()}.

Both \code{nEventsIA} and \code{tEventsIA} require a group sequential design
for a time-to-event endpoint of class \code{gsSurv} as input.
\code{nEventsIA} calculates the expected number of events under the
alternate hypothesis at a given interim time. \code{tEventsIA} calculates
the time that the expected number of events under the alternate hypothesis
is a given proportion of the total events planned for the final analysis.

\code{nSurv()} produces an object of class \code{nSurv} with the number of
subjects and events for a set of pre-specified trial parameters, such as
accrual duration and follow-up period. The underlying power calculation is
based on Lachin and Foulkes (1986) method for proportional hazards assuming
a fixed underlying hazard ratio between 2 treatment groups. The method has
been extended here to enable designs to test non-inferiority. Piecewise
constant enrollment and failure rates are assumed and a stratified
population is allowed. See also \code{\link{nSurvival}} for other Lachin and
Foulkes (1986) methods assuming a constant hazard difference or exponential
enrollment rate.

When study duration (\code{T}) and follow-up duration (\code{minfup}) are
fixed, \code{nSurv} applies exactly the Lachin and Foulkes (1986) method of
computing sample size under the proportional hazards assumption.
For this computation, enrollment rates are altered proportionately to those
input in \code{gamma} to achieve the power of interest.

Given the specified enrollment rate(s) input in \code{gamma}, \code{nSurv}
may also be used to derive enrollment duration required for a trial to have
defined power if \code{T} is input as \code{NULL}; in this case, both
\code{R} (enrollment duration for each specified enrollment rate) and
\code{T} (study duration) will be computed on output.

Alternatively and also using the fixed enrollment rate(s) in \code{gamma},
if minimum follow-up \code{minfup} is specified as \code{NULL}, then the
enrollment duration(s) specified in \code{R} are considered fixed and
\code{minfup} and \code{T} are computed to derive the desired power. This
method will fail if the specified enrollment rates and durations either
over-powers the trial with no additional follow-up or underpowers the trial
with infinite follow-up. This method produces a corresponding error message
in such cases.

The input to \code{gsSurv} is a combination of the input to \code{nSurv()}
and \code{gsDesign()}.

\code{nEventsIA()} is provided to compute the expected number of events at a
given point in time given enrollment, event and censoring rates. The routine
is used with a root finding routine to approximate the approximate timing of
an interim analysis. It is also used to extend enrollment or follow-up of a
fixed design to obtain a sufficient number of events to power a group
sequential design.
