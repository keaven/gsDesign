\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of type \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsProbability}}

\item{theta}{a vector with \eqn{\theta}{theta} value(s) at which conditional
power is to be computed; for \code{gsCP()} if \code{NULL}, an estimated
value of \eqn{\theta}{theta} based on the interim test statistic
(\code{zi/sqrt(x$n.I[i])}) as well as at \code{x$theta} is computed. For
\code{gsPosterior}, this may be a scalar or an interval; for \code{gsPP} and
\code{gsCP}, this must be a scalar.}

\item{i}{analysis at which interim z-value is given; must be from 1 to
\code{x$k-1}}

\item{zi}{interim z-value at analysis i (scalar)}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.  Larger
values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.  Normally
\code{r} will not be changed by the user.}

\item{wgts}{Weights to be used with grid points in \code{theta}. Length can
be one if weights are equal, otherwise should be the same length as
\code{theta}. Values should be positive, but do not need to sum to 1.}

\item{total}{The default of \code{total=TRUE} produces the combined
probability for all planned analyses after the interim analysis specified in
\code{i}. Otherwise, information on each analysis is provided separately.}

\item{j}{specific analysis for which prediction is being made; must be
\code{>i} and no more than \code{x$k}}

\item{level}{The level to be used for Bayes credible intervals (which
approach confidence intervals for vague priors). The default
\code{level=.95} corresponds to a 95\% credible interval. \code{level=0}
provides a point estimate rather than an interval.}

\item{prior}{provides a prior distribution in the form produced by
\code{\link{normalGrid}}}
}
\value{
\code{gsCP()} returns an object of the class \code{gsProbability}.
Based on the input design and the interim test statistic, the output
gsDesign object has bounds for test statistics computed based on solely on
observations after interim \code{i}.  Boundary crossing probabilities are
computed for the input \eqn{\theta}{theta} values. See manual and examples.

\code{gsPP()} if total==TRUE, returns a real value indicating the predictive
power of the trial conditional on the interim test statistic \code{zi} at
analysis \code{i}; otherwise returns vector with predictive power for each
future planned analysis.

\code{gsPI()} returns an interval (or point estimate if \code{level=0})
indicating 100\code{level}\% credible interval for the z-statistic at
analysis \code{j} conditional on the z-statistic at analysis \code{i<j}.
The interval does not consider intervending interim analyses. The
probability estimate is based on the predictive distribution used for
\code{gsPP()} and requires a prior distribution for the group sequential
parameter \code{theta} specified in \code{theta} and \code{wgts}.

\code{gsPosterior()} returns a posterior distribution containing the the
vector \code{z} input in \code{prior$z}, the posterior density in
\code{density}, grid weights for integrating the posterior density as input
in \code{prior$gridwgts} or defaulted to a vector of ones, and the product
of the output values in \code{density} and \code{gridwgts} in \code{wgts}.

\code{gsPOS()} returns a real value indicating the probability of a positive
study weighted by the prior distribution input for \code{theta}.

\code{gsCPOS()} returns a real value indicating the probability of a
positive study weighted by the posterior distribution derived from the
interim test statistic and the prior distribution input for \code{theta}
conditional on an interim test statistic.

\description{
\code{gsCP()} computes conditional boundary crossing probabilities at future
planned analyses for a given group sequential design assuming an interim
z-statistic at a specified interim analysis. While \code{gsCP()} is designed
toward computing conditional power for a variety of underlying parameter
values, \code{\link{condPower}} is built to compute conditional power for a
variety of interim test statistic values which is useful for sample size
adaptation (see \code{\link{ssrCP}}). \code{gsPP()} averages conditional
power across a posterior distribution to compute predictive power.
\code{gsPI()} computes Bayesian prediction intervals for future analyses
corresponding to results produced by \code{gsPP()}.  \code{gsPosterior()}
computes the posterior density for the group sequential design parameter of
interest given a prior density and an interim outcome that is exact or in an
interval. \code{gsPOS()} computes the probability of success for a trial
using a prior distribution to average power over a set of \code{theta}
values of interest. \code{gsCPOS()} assumes no boundary has been crossed
before and including an interim analysis of interest, and computes the
probability of success based on this event. Note that \code{gsCP()} and
\code{gsPP()} take only the interim test statistic into account in computing
conditional probabilities, while \code{gsCPOS()} conditions on not crossing
any bound through a specified interim analysis.

See Conditional power section of manual for further clarification. See also
Muller and Schaffer (2001) for background theory.

For \code{gsPP()}, \code{gsPI()}, \code{gsPOS()} and \code{gsCPOS()}, the
prior distribution for the standardized parameter \code{theta} () for a
group sequential design specified through a gsDesign object is specified
through the arguments \code{theta} and \code{wgts}. This can be a discrete
or a continuous probability density function. For a discrete function,
generally all weights would be 1. For a continuous density, the \code{wgts}
would contain integration grid weights, such as those provided by
\link{normalGrid}.

For \code{gsPosterior}, a prior distribution in \code{prior} must be
composed of the vectors \code{z} \code{density}.  The vector \code{z}
contains points where the prior is evaluated and \code{density} the
corresponding density or, for a discrete distribution, the probabilities of
each point in \code{z}. Densities may be supplied as from
\code{normalGrid()} where grid weights for numerical integration are
supplied in \code{gridwgts}. If \code{gridwgts} are not supplied, they are
defaulted to 1 (equal weighting). To ensure a proper prior distribution, you
must have \code{sum(gridwgts * density)} equal to 1; this is NOT checked,
however.
