\title{Normal distribution sample size (2-sample)}
\usage{
nNormal(delta1 = 1, sd = 1.7, sd2 = NULL, alpha = 0.025,
  beta = 0.1, ratio = 1, sided = 1, n = NULL, delta0 = 0,
  outtype = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta1}{difference between sample means under the alternate
hypothesis.}

\item{sd}{Standard deviation for the control arm.}

\item{sd2}{Standard deviation of experimental arm; this will be set to be
the same as the control arm with the default of \code{NULL}.}

\item{alpha}{type I error rate. Default is 0.025 since 1-sided testing is
default.}

\item{beta}{type II error rate. Default is 0.10 (90\% power). Not needed if
\code{n} is provided.}

\item{ratio}{randomization ratio of experimental group compared to control.}

\item{sided}{1 for 1-sided test (default), 2 for 2-sided test.}

\item{n}{Sample size; may be input to compute power rather than sample size.
If \code{NULL} (default) then sample size is computed.}

\item{delta0}{difference between sample means under the null hypothesis;
normally this will be left as the default of 0.}

\item{outtype}{controls output; see value section below.}
}
\value{
If \code{n} is \code{NULL} (default), total sample size (2 arms
combined) is computed. Otherwise, power is computed. If \code{outtype=1}
(default), the computed value (sample size or power) is returned in a scalar
or vector. If \code{outtype=2}, a data frame with sample sizes for each arm
(\code{n1}, \code{n2})is returned; if \code{n} is not input as \code{NULL},
a third variable, \code{Power}, is added to the output data frame. If
\code{outtype=3}, a data frame with is returned with the following columns:
\item{n}{A vector with total samples size required for each event rate
comparison specified} \item{n1}{A vector of sample sizes for group 1 for
each event rate comparison specified} \item{n2}{A vector of sample sizes for
group 2 for each event rate comparison specified} \item{alpha}{As input}
\item{sided}{As input} \item{beta}{As input; if \code{n} is input, this is
computed} \item{Power}{If \code{n=NULL} on input, this is \code{1-beta};
otherwise, the power is computed for each sample size input} \item{sd}{As
input} \item{sd2}{As input} \item{delta1}{As input} \item{delta0}{As input}
\item{se}{standard error for estimate of difference in treatment group
means}
}
\description{
\code{nNormal()} computes a fixed design sample size for comparing 2 means
where variance is known. T The function allows computation of sample size
for a non-inferiority hypothesis. Note that you may wish to investigate 
other R packages such as the \code{pwr} package which uses the t-distribution.
In the examples below we show how to set up a 2-arm group sequential design with a normal outcome. 

\code{nNormal()} computes sample size for comparing two normal means when
the variance for observations in
