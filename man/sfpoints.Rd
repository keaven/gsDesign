\title{Pointwise Spending Function}
\usage{
sfPoints(alpha, t, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Real value \eqn{> 0} and no more than 1. Normally,
\code{alpha=0.025} for one-sided Type I error specification or
\code{alpha=0.1} for Type II error specification. However, this could be set
to 1 if for descriptive purposes you wish to see the proportion of spending
as a function of the proportion of sample size/information.}

\item{t}{A vector of points with increasing values from >0 and <=1.  Values
of the proportion of sample size/information for which the spending function
will be computed.}

\item{param}{A vector of the same length as \code{t} specifying the
cumulative proportion of spending to corresponding to each point in
\code{t}; must be >=0 and <=1.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{spendfn}. See spending functions for further
details.
}
\description{
The function \code{sfPoints} implements a spending function with values
specified for an arbitrary set of specified points. It is now recommended to
use sfLinear rather than sfPoints. Normally \code{sfPoints} will be passed
to \code{gsDesign} in the parameter \code{sfu} for the upper bound or
\code{sfl} for the lower bound to specify a spending function family for a
design. In this case, the user does not need to know the calling sequence,
just the points they wish to specify. If using \code{sfPoints()} in a
design, it is recommended to specify how to interpolate between the
specified points (e.g,, linear interpolation); also consider fitting smooth
spending functions; see \link{Spending function overview}.

# change to cumulative proportion of spending
for (i in 2:length(y))
  y[i] <- y[i - 1] + y[i]

# this should correspond to input sfupar
round(y, 6)

# plot these cumulative spending points
plot(1:6 / 6, y,
  main = "Pointwise spending function example",

# by fitting 3 points

# example without lower spending at initial interim or
# upper spending at last interim

  sfl = sfPoints, sflpar = c(0, .25)
