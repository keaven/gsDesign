\title{Group sequential design interim density function}
\usage{
gsDensity(x, theta = 0, i = 1, zi = 0, r = 18)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of type \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsProbability}}

\item{theta}{a vector with \eqn{\theta}{theta} value(s) at which the interim
density function is to be computed.}

\item{i}{analysis at which interim z-values are given; must be from 1 to
\code{x$k}}

\item{zi}{interim z-value at analysis \code{i} (scalar)}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.  Larger
values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.  Normally
\code{r} will not be changed by the user.}
}
\value{
\item{zi}{The input vector \code{zi}.} \item{theta}{The input vector
\code{theta}.} \item{density}{A matrix with \code{length(zi)} rows and
\code{length(theta)} columns.  The subdensity function for \code{z[j]},
\code{theta[m]} at analysis \code{i} is returned in \code{density[j,m]}. }
}
\description{
Given an interim analysis \code{i} of a group sequential design and a vector
of real values \code{zi}, \code{gsDensity()} computes an interim density
function at analysis \code{i} at the values in \code{zi}.  For each value in
\code{zi}, this interim density is the derivative of the probability that
the group sequential trial does not cross a boundary prior to the
\code{i}-th analysis and at the \code{i}-th analysis the interim Z-statistic
is less than that value. When integrated over the real line, this density
computes the probability of not crossing a bound at a previous analysis. It
corresponds to the subdistribution function at analysis \code{i} that
excludes the probability of crossing a bound at an earlier analysis.

The initial purpose of this routine was as a component needed to compute the
predictive power for a trial given an interim result; see
\code{\link{gsPP}}.

See Jennison and Turnbull (2000) for details on how these computations are
performed.
