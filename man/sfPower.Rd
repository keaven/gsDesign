\title{Kim-DeMets (power) Spending Function}
\usage{
sfPower(alpha, t, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Real value \eqn{> 0} and no more than 1. Normally,
\code{alpha=0.025} for one-sided Type I error specification or
\code{alpha=0.1} for Type II error specification. However, this could be set
to 1 if for descriptive purposes you wish to see the proportion of spending
as a function of the proportion of sample size/information.}

\item{t}{A vector of points with increasing values from 0 to 1, inclusive.
Values of the proportion of sample size/information for which the spending
function will be computed.}

\item{param}{A single, positive value specifying the \eqn{\rho}{rho}
parameter for which Kim-DeMets spending is to be computed; allowable range
is (0,15]}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{spendfn}. See \link{Spending_Function_Overview} for further details.
}
\description{
The function \code{sfPower()} implements a Kim-DeMets (power) spending
function. This is a flexible, one-parameter spending function recommended by
Jennison and Turnbull (2000). Normally it will be passed to
\code{gsDesign()} in the parameter \code{sfu} for the upper bound or
\code{sfl} for the lower bound to specify a spending function family for a
design. In this case, the user does not need to know the calling sequence.
The calling sequence is useful, however, when the user wishes to plot a
spending function as demonstrated below in examples.

A Kim-DeMets spending function takes the form \deqn{f(t;\alpha,\rho)=\alpha
t^\rho}{f(t; alpha, rho) = alpha t^rho} where \eqn{\rho}{rho} is the value
passed in \code{param}. See examples below for a range of values of
\eqn{\rho}{rho} that may be of interest (\code{param=0.75} to \code{3} are
documented there).
