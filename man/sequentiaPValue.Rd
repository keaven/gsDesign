\usage{
sequentialPValue(
  gsD = gsDesign(),
  n.I = NULL,
  Z = NULL,
  usTime = NULL,
  interval = c(1e-05, 0.9999)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gsD}{Group sequential design generated by \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsSurv}.}

\item{n.I}{Event counts (for time-to-event outcomes) or sample size (for most other designs); numeric vector with increasing, positive values with at most one
value greater than or equal to largest value in \code{gsD$n.I}; NOTE: if NULL, planned n.I will be used (\code{gsD$n.I}).}

\item{Z}{Z-value tests corresponding to analyses in \code{n.I}; positive values indicate a positive finding; must have the same length as \code{n.I}.}

\item{usTime}{Spending time for upper bound at specified analyses; specify default: \code{NULL} if this is to be based on information fraction; 
if not \code{NULL}, must have the same length as \code{n.I}; increasing positive values with at most 1 greater than or equal to 1.}

\item{interval}{Interval for search to derive p-value; Default: \code{c(1e-05, 0.9999)}. Lower end of interval must be >0 and upper end must be < 1. 
The primary reason to not use the defaults would likely be if a test were vs a Type I error <0.0001.}
}
\value{
Sequential p-value (single numeric one-sided p-value between 0 and 1). 
Note that if the sequential p-value is less than the lower end of the input interval, 
the lower of interval will be returned.
Similarly, if the sequential p-value is greater than the upper end of the input interval, 
then the upper end of interval is returned.
}
\description{
\code{sequentialPValue} computes a sequential p-value for a group sequential design using a spending function as described in 
Maurer and Bretz (2013) and previously defined by Liu and Anderson (2008).
It is the minimum of repeated p-values computed at each analysis (Jennison and Turnbull, 2000).
This is particularly useful for multiplicity methods such as the graphical method for group sequential designs 
where sequential p-values for multiple hypotheses can be used as nominal p-values to plug into a multiplicity graph. 
A sequential p-value is described as the minimum alpha level at which a one-sided group sequential bound would 
be rejected given interim and final observed results.
It is meaningful for both one-sided designs and designs with non-binding futility bounds (\code{test.type} 1, 4, 6), 
but not for 2-sided designs with binding futility bounds (\code{test.type} 2, 3 or 5).
Mild restrictions are required on spending functions used, but these are satisfied for commonly used spending functions
such as the Lan-DeMets spending function approximating an O'Brien-Fleming bound or a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function; see Maurer and Bretz (2013).
}
\details{
Solution is found with a search using \code{uniroot}.
This finds the maximum alpha-level for which an efficacy bound is crossed, 
completely ignoring any futility bound.
