\description{
\code{nSurvival()} is used to calculate the sample size for a clinical trial
with a time-to-event endpoint. The Lachin and Foulkes (1986) method is used.
\code{nEvents} uses the Schoenfeld (1981) approximation to provide sample
size and power in terms of the underlying hazard ratio and the number of
events observed in a survival analysis. The functions \code{hrz2n()},
\code{hrn2z()} and \code{zn2hr()} also use the Schoenfeld approximation to
provide simple translations between hazard ratios, z-values and the number
of events in an analysis; input variables can be given as vectors.

\code{nSurvival()} produces an object of class "nSurvival" with the number
of subjects and events for a set of pre-specified trial parameters, such as
accrual duration and follow-up period. The calculation is based on Lachin
and Foulkes (1986) method and can be used for risk ratio or risk difference.
The function also consider non-uniform (exponential) entry as well as
uniform entry.

If the logical \code{approx} is \code{TRUE}, the variance under alternative
hypothesis is used to replace the variance under null hypothesis.  For
non-uniform entry, a non-zero value of \code{gamma} for exponential entry
must be supplied. For positive \code{gamma}, the entry distribution is
convex, whereas for negative \code{gamma}, the entry distribution is
concave.

\code{nEvents()} uses the Schoenfeld (1981) method to approximate the number
of events \code{n} (given \code{beta}) or the power (given \code{n}).
Arguments may be vectors or scalars, but any vectors must have the same
length.

The functions \code{hrz2n}, \code{hrn2z} and \code{zn2hr} also all apply the
Schoenfeld approximation for proportional hazards modelling.  This
approximation is based on the asymptotic normal distribtuion of the logrank
statistic as well as related statistics are asymptotically normal.  Let
\eqn{\lambda} denote the underlying hazard ratio (\code{lambda1/lambda2} in
terms of the arguments to \code{nSurvival}). Further, let \eqn{n} denote the
number of events observed when computing the statistic of interest and
\eqn{r} the ratio of the sample size in an experimental group relative to a
control. The estimated natural logarithm of the hazard ratio from a
proportional hazards ratio is approximately normal with a mean of
\eqn{log{\lambda}} and variance \eqn{(1+r)^2/nr}. Let \eqn{z} denote a
logrank statistic (or a Wald statistic or score statistic from a
proportional hazards regression model). The same asymptotic theory implies
\eqn{z} is asymptotically equivalent to a normalized estimate of the hazard
ratio \eqn{\lambda} and thus \eqn{z} is asymptotically normal with variance
1 and mean \deqn{\frac{log{\lambda}r}{(1+r)^2}.} Plugging the estimated
hazard ratio into the above equation allows approximating any one of the
following based on the other two: the estimate hazard ratio, the number of
events and the z-statistic. That is, \deqn{\hat{\lambda}=
\exp(z(1+r)/\sqrt{rn})} \deqn{z=log(\hat{\lambda})\sqrt{nr}/(1+r)} \deqn{n=
(z(1+r)/log(\hat{\lambda}))^2/r.}

\code{hrz2n()} translates an observed interim hazard ratio and interim
z-value into the number of events required for the Z-value and hazard ratio
to correspond to each other. \code{hrn2z()} translates a hazard ratio and
number of events into an approximate corresponding Z-value. \code{zn2hr()}
translates a Z-value and number of events into an approximate corresponding
hazard ratio. Each of these functions has a default assumption of an
underlying hazard ratio of 1 which can be changed using the argument
\code{hr0}. \code{hrn2z()} and \code{zn2hr()} also have an argument
\code{hr1} which is only used to compute the sign of the computed Z-value in
the case of \code{hrn2z()} and whether or not a z-value > 0 corresponds to a
hazard ratio > or < the null hazard ratio \code{hr0}.
