\usage{
sfLDOF(alpha, t, param)

sfLDPocock(alpha, t, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Real value \eqn{> 0} and no more than 1. Normally,
\code{alpha=0.025} for one-sided Type I error specification or
\code{alpha=0.1} for Type II error specification. However, this could be set
to 1 if for descriptive purposes you wish to see the proportion of spending
as a function of the proportion of sample size/information.}

\item{t}{A vector of points with increasing values from 0 to 1, inclusive.
Values of the proportion of sample size/information for which the spending
function will be computed.}

\item{param}{This parameter is not used and need not be specified. It is
here so that the calling sequence conforms the to the standard for spending
functions used with \code{gsDesign()}.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{spendfn}. See spending functions for further
details.

\description{
Lan and DeMets (1983) first published the method of using spending functions
to set boundaries for group sequential trials. In this publication they
proposed two specific spending functions: one to approximate an
O'Brien-Fleming design and the other to approximate a Pocock design. Both of
these spending functions are available here, mainly for historical purposes.
Neither requires a parameter.

The Lan-DeMets (1983) spending function to approximate an O'Brien-Fleming
bound is implemented in the function (\code{sfLDOF()}): \deqn{f(t;
\alpha)=2-2\Phi\left(\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha/2)/ t^{1/2}\right).}{% f(t;
alpha)=2-2*Phi(Phi^(-1)(1-alpha/2)/t^(1/2)\right).} The Lan-DeMets (1983)
spending function to approximate a Pocock design is implemented in the
function \code{sfLDPocock()}:
\deqn{f(t;\alpha)=ln(1+(e-1)t).}{f(t;alpha)=ln(1+(e-1)t).} As shown in
examples below, other spending functions can be used to get as good or
better approximations to Pocock and O'Brien-Fleming bounds. In particular,
O'Brien-Fleming bounds can be closely approximated using
\code{\link{sfExponential}}.
