\title{Hwang-Shih-DeCani Spending Function}
\usage{
sfHSD(alpha, t, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{Real value \eqn{> 0} and no more than 1. Normally,
\code{alpha=0.025} for one-sided Type I error specification or
\code{alpha=0.1} for Type II error specification. However, this could be set
to 1 if for descriptive purposes you wish to see the proportion of spending
as a function of the proportion of sample size/information.}

\item{t}{A vector of points with increasing values from 0 to 1, inclusive.
Values of the proportion of sample size/information for which the spending
function will be computed.}

\item{param}{A single real value specifying the gamma parameter for which
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending is to be computed; allowable range is [-40, 40]}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{spendfn}. See \link{Spending_Function_Overview} for further details.
}
\description{
The function \code{sfHSD} implements a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function.
This is the default spending function for \code{gsDesign()}. Normally it
will be passed to \code{gsDesign} in the parameter \code{sfu} for the upper
bound or \code{sfl} for the lower bound to specify a spending function
family for a design. In this case, the user does not need to know the
calling sequence. The calling sequence is useful, however, when the user
wishes to plot a spending function as demonstrated below in examples.

A Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function takes the form \deqn{f(t;\alpha,
\gamma)=\alpha(1-e^{-\gamma t})/(1-e^{-\gamma})}{f(t; alpha, gamma) = alpha
* (1-exp(-gamma * t))/(1 - exp(-gamma))} where \eqn{\gamma}{gamma} is the
value passed in \code{param}. A value of \eqn{\gamma=-4}{gamma=-4} is used
to approximate an O'Brien-Fleming design (see \code{\link{sfExponential}}
for a better fit), while a value of \eqn{\gamma=1}{gamma=1} approximates a
Pocock design well.

library(ggplot2)
# design a 4-analysis trial using a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function
# for both lower and upper bounds
x <- gsDesign(k = 4, sfu = sfHSD, sfupar = -2, sfl = sfHSD, sflpar = 1)

# print the design
x

# since sfHSD is the default for both sfu and sfl,
# this could have been written as
x <- gsDesign(k = 4, sfupar = -2, sflpar = 1)

# print again
x

# plot the spending function using many points to obtain a smooth curve
# show default values of gamma to see how the spending function changes
# also show gamma=1 which is supposed to approximate a Pocock design
