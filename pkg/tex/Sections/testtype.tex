\subsection{Binding and non-binding futility bounds\label{sec:nonbinding}}

For one-sided testing (\texttt{test.type=1}) and for non-binding lower bounds
(\texttt{test.type}=4 or 6), (\ref{alpha(theta)}) is not used for computing
Type I error. In these cases, $\alpha_{i}(\theta)$ is replaced for
$i=1,2,...K$ by
