\ProvidesClass{upquote}[2000/12/11 Covington's upright-quote modification to verbatim and verb]

% Bug fix, 2000/12/11: previously, '0 (or ' and any digit) would print as a nonexistent character.
%   (The reason:  \char13 or \char18 was combining with the digit to make \char130, etc.)
%   Fixed by adding curly brackets.

% Problem:  Computer Modern Typewriter is the best font for program listings, *but*
%           it prints ` ' as bent opening and closing single quotes.  Other fonts,
%           and most programming languages, print ` as a grave accent and ' upright;
%           ' is used both to open and to close quoted strings.

%           See also M. Covington, "Computer Languages in Type," Journal of Scholarly
%           Publishing 26.1:34-41 (1994).

% Solution: This package switches the typewriter font to Computer Modern Typewriter 
%           (regardless of other fonts in use, so long as this package is called afterward)
%           and modifies the behavior of verbatim, verbatim*, verb, and verb* to
%           print ` ' the desired way.  It does not affect \tt, \texttt, etc.

% The modification is done by adding instructions to \@noligs, 
% which is called by verbatim and verb in order to turn the 
% characters ` < > , ' - into active characters that merely
% print themselves rather than activating ligatures.
%
% What is added is code to redefine ` as grave and ' as upright single quote.

% In each of the following groups, a character has to be reclassified so that 
% a macro can be written that will define the character itself as a macro.
